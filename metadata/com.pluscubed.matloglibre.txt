Name:MatLog Libre
Auto Name:${appName}
Summary:Material Design logcat reader based on CatLog
Description:
Debug your apps. Find error stacktraces. See what your phone is saying about you
behind your back. It's all there in the system log, aka logcat!

MatLog shows a scrolling (tailed) view of the Android "logcat" system log, hence
the goofy name. It also allows you to record logs in real time, send logs via
email, and filter using a variety of criteria.

* Color-coded tag names
* Easy-to-read column display
* Real-time search
* Recording mode (with widget)
* Save & open from SD card
* Send logs as email or attachment
* Auto-scrolls when at the bottom of the screen
* Search autosuggestions & saved filters
* Select and save parts of logs
* Open-source and ad-free
* Material goodness
